VPL stands for Volleyball Premier League algorithm which is a population based, human-inspired, meta-heuristic algorithm 
intelligently tailored to solve global optimization problems.
the details of the algorithm is published in Applied Soft Computing journal (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494617307068).

The proposed algorithm is benchmarked on 23 well-known test functions, which are categorized into three groups, namely unimodal, 
multimodal and fixed-dimension multimodal functions. The solutions obtained using the VPL have been compared with other 
metaheuristic algorithms including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Genetic Algorithm (GA), 
Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Firefly Algorithm (FA), Harmony Search (HS), Sin Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Soccer League Competition (SLC), 
and League Championship Algorithm (LCA). In addition, VPL has been used to solve three classical engineering design optimization problems. 
Results show that VPL algorithm possesses a strong capability to produce superior performance over the other well-known 
metaheuristic algorithms. The results of the experiments also show that the VPL is effectively applicable to solve problems with 
complex search space.
